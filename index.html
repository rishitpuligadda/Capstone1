            Straddling the line between the urge to always play and the thrist for knowledge, I'm on a quest to find harmony.

            Hi there, My name is Rishit and I'm currently trying to learn full stack development and This is my first Capstone Project.</br>
            The reason why I'm learning full stack development is so that I can integrate my  future hardware projects with software and be able to remotely control them.</br>
            One such project is:</br>
            A car which would contain the following features
            <ol>
                <li>Self-driving</li>
                <li>Path follower</li>
                <li>Remotely Controlable</li>
            </ol>
            The features which can be integrated with software are:
            <ul>
                <li>Path follower: Where the user can draw a path of choice on the website and the car would try to replicate the path drawn.</li>
                <li>Remote Control: The website would contain the widgets of a controler which can be used to control the car.</li>
            </ul>
        </P>
